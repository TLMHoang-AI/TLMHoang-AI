- Hi, I’m @TLMHoang-AI (Tran Ly Minh Hoang)
- I’m passionate about AI research, machine learning/Deep learning applications.
- I’m currently pursuing AI Engineering at FPT University and exploring topics like computer vision, transformers, and generative models.
- I enjoy building mini-games and interactive AI demos with Python (Pygame, Unity ML Agents).
- I'm especially interested in combining AI with real-world tools (e.g., farm tech, medical AI, educational games).
- Tools I work with: PyTorch, TensorFlow, YOLOv8, Streamlit, OpenCV, Flask, and a bit of Unity.
- I’m looking to collaborate on AI + Game projects (educational or experimental), or open-source computer vision tools.
